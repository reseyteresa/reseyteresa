**Course:** ECON 6018 (Master’s Level)  
**Instructor:** Teresa Ng  
**Date:** 13 February 2026  

This tutorial develops **Partial Derivatives and Implicit Differentiation**, two essential tools in graduate-level economics.  
The session emphasizes conceptual clarity, structured computation, and exam-speed problem solving for multivariable optimization and comparative statics.

## Topics Covered

* Definition of partial derivatives  
* Holding variables constant interpretation  
* First- and second-order partial derivatives  
* Chain rule for multivariable functions  
* Implicit differentiation  
* Applications to economic modeling  
* Practice exercises for speed and accuracy

## Tutorial Materials

* [Partial Derivatives & Implicit Differentiation Tutorial 4 Notes (PDF)](/files/ECON6018_Tutorial4_Differentiation.pdf)

## Notes

This tutorial builds on prior differentiation techniques and extends them to multivariable settings.  
It is particularly important for:

* Utility maximization  
* Cost minimization  
* Comparative statics  
* Econometric derivations involving matrix and multivariate calculus  

Students are encouraged to practice computation fluency, as these techniques are heavily used in graduate microeconomics and econometrics.
